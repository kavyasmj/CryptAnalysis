the midterm exam will be closed book, closed notes, and closed everything (and no "cheat sheet"). also, no calculators, cell phones, or any electronic gadgets are allowed. please bring a photo id. your id will be collected at the beginning of the exam and will be returned to you when you turn in your exam. there will be assigned seating. the midterm exam will cover everything from the beginning of the semester till what was covered by the end of lecture on 3/7/2006 (will not include cryptanalysis of classical ciphers). here is a quick summary of the topics (not all topics covered are listed): overview functions bi-jections and inverses one-way functions and trapdoor one-way functions permutations encryption schemes max number of permutations model of communication and channels types of adversaries types of cryptanalysis symmetric-key encryption model of communication and channels block ciphers substitution ciphers mono-alphabetic substitution cipher homophonic substitution cipher polyalphabetic substitution cipher transposition ciphers composition of ciphers and product ciphers stream ciphers vernam ciphers and one-time pad key space issues digital signatures signing and verification transformations authentication and identification entity vs. data origina authentication public-key cryptography necessity of authentication digital signature from reversible public-key encryption cryptographic hash functions one-wayness weak collision-resistance strong collision-resistance keyed vs. unkeyed hash functions protocols and mechanisms protocol failures key management symmetric-key and trusted third party public-key and certificate authority attacks ciphertext-only known-plaintext chosen-plaintext chosen-ciphertext security models unconditional security complexity-theoretic security provable security computational security ad hoc security pseudorandom bit generators linear congruential generator polynomial-time statistical tests statistics background normal distribution chi-square distribution five basic tests frequency (mono-bit) test serial (two-bit) test poker test runs test autocorrelation test cryptographically secure prbg rsa pseudorandom bit generator blum-blum-shub pseudorandom bit generator stream ciphers synchronous vs. self-synchronizing stream ciphers lfsr connection polynomial math background number theory abstract algebra group ring field polynomial ring finite field linear complexity berlekamp-massey algorithm non-linear fsr de bruijn fsr stream ciphers based on lfsrs geffe generator correlation attacks and correlation immunity summation generator non-linear filter generator and knapsack generator clock controlled generators alternating step generator shrinking generator stream ciphers not based on lfsrs rc4 seal block ciphers attacks complexity of attacks modes of operation ecb cbc cfb ofb cascade cipher and multiple encryption meet-in-the-middle attacks known-plaintext unicity distance classical ciphers simple transposition ciphers mono-alphabetic substitution cipher polygram substitution cipher homophonic substitution cipher cryptographic codes polyalphabetic substitution cipher vigenere cipher and variants jefferson cylinders and rotors and the enigma machine
